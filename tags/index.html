<p>For too long I was playing games against the game itself. That is, I believed that, objectively and regardless of the opponent, there is an optimal strategy by which victory is achieved. The point, whether in a study or in a match, was to find that strategy. This view created great pressure to find an optimal move and, at the same time, undue frustration when any positional advantage could not be realized.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 bg-black lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Years ago, got nostalgic for the time of youth and searched an old video game <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1324/elite/">Elite</a> I played on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>. Got upon <a href="https://pioneerspacesim.net/#slide0">pioneer</a>. I loved it and tried to help in order for players to have stronger feeling of progress. I did a lengthy <a href="https://github.com/jimishol/Pioneerspacesim_trading_economy/files/7077355/pionner-economy.pdf">analysis</a> in a relevant <a href="https://github.com/jimishol/Pioneerspacesim_trading_economy">repository</a>. The main idea was finally accepted, but the consequence to control the progress of player was still to come. I do not play the game any more but one great feature it has, is that supports mod. I created one such <a href="https://github.com/jimishol/Pioneerspacesim_trading_economy/tree/main/docs/economy_mod">mod</a> on this <a href="https://github.com/jimishol/pioneer">fork</a>. Unfortunately, I think it does not work as it is. Probably, a git revert of few commits, at a stage where the mod was working, might needed if anyone want to try my mod.

      <p>About three and a half decades ago, before the advent of computers, I played classical guitar. At some point I wanted to express myself and, after buying and studying a book of harmony, I composed a piece. Because of its unusual chords, however, I had difficulty keeping the tempo. Then came computers with DOS and probably with the first windows, I was introduced to midi. The piece, after several attempts and separating the voices into instruments, somehow managed to be heard. From then on, for more than thirty years, I was firmly convinced that I had composed something and that all that was needed was a real musician who, with minimal editing, would make it sound as it should. (What a wrong impression!)</p>

<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29">musical interval</a>, as the difference between two pitches, can be defined in an absolute way as the number of semitones that separate them. But the total number of semitones of an octave is 12, while the notes of a scale are 7. The relation of tones in a melody is necessarily expressed as the relation between the 7 tones of the scale used. Thus, to define an interval, it is necessary to use two terms. The first noun term will indicate the relationship to the 7 tones of the scale and the second, as an adjective of the first, will specify the exact interval in number of semitones.</p>

      <p>The A minor scale is related to C major, in that they share the same, empty, key signature. These scales are two different sevenths of white keys on the piano. Because the notes are repeated in octaves, there could be five other different sets of white keys, that is with the same, blank, signature, defining different tonalities. I understood that, in the most, the two mentioned above were imposed, but I always wondered about the other, blank-signed, scales.</p>

      <p>At one time, when I was working, I used <a href="https://librecad.org/">librcad</a>. When I first used it, I had difficulties printing Greek text on drawings.

Despite the six installed Greek fonts, I couldn&rsquo;t write Greek comfortably (at least with the MText command).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://forum.librecad.org/greek-fonts-large-file-from-dwg-to-librecad-td5714230.html">post of mine</a>, I mentioned that, to solve the problem, I reorganized greeks.lff to put the characters on the appropriate, for today, keyboard keys and designed a final &rsquo;s&rsquo;. I named the modified file greeks-mine.lff. Also, to have the Greek in unicode I merged greeks-mine.lff into unicode.lff and added the vowels with accents. I named this modified file unicode-mine.lff. I don&rsquo;t know if there is a licensing problem, as mentioned in another <a href="https://forum.librecad.org/Insert-text-in-greek-language-td5717563.html">post</a>, but my fonts still work flawlessly today.</p>

      <p>I just finished reading the book &ldquo;An introduction to Game Theory&rdquo; by Martin J. Osborne. A truly wonderful book, which seems to have influenced even my everyday thinking. Its only problem, for me, is that it tries too hard not to make it necessary, for its reader, to use even elementary algebra.</p>
<p>Its beauty, however, lies mainly in the carefully chosen exercises. At the beginning of the book, they seem so elementary that they make you wonder, and even bore you to solve them. But they unfold, from the middle of the book onwards, in a surprisingly beautiful and inventive way.</p>
